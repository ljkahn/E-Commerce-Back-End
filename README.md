# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Installation
To install the e-commerce back end, git clone the repository onto your local machine. Run 'npm i' in the terminal to download the libraries needed to run this app. Then create the database in MySQL Workbench based off the schema.sql file in the db directory. Once the database is created, run "npm run seed" to seed the data into the database. Once the database is seeded, the end points for testing are commented out above each route in the category-routes.js, product-routes.js, and tag-routes.js. The post and put routes will need JSON objects with the correct parameters entered into Insomnia.
