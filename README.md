# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Installation
To install this e-commerce back end, clone the repository onto your local machine. Run 'npm i' in the terminal to download the libraries needed to run this app. The user must then create the database in MySQL Workbench based off the schema.sql file in the db directory. Once the database is created, run "npm run seed" in the vs code terminal to seed the data into the database. Once the database is seeded, the end points for testing are commented out above each route in the category-routes.js, product-routes.js, and tag-routes.js.

I did not collaborate with anyone but I received help from the University of Denver's support team.
